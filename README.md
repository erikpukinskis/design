How to design


1 / values / what should happen?
2 / prototyping / one more tool
3 / research / notice
4 / strategy / decision time
5 / production / participation
6 / engineering / automation
7 / release / let's get you paid wall
8 / marketing / this homie needs a customer


phase 0: values
--------------------
(you don't have an idea)

what do you care about? 


phase 1: vision 
--------------------
(you know what you care about, but you don't know what to do)

what's something in that realm that people could do if they were organized?

what steps would they take?


phase 2: prototyping
---------------------------
(you have a vision but no prototype)

what tools will people in your vision need that don't exist?

what's the easiest way you could provide a quick'n'dirty version of one of those tools right now? fake everything.


phase 3: research  // isn't this just production?
------------------------
(you have a prototype)

who is available and would be good at the job if it existed?

give them the tool

act out support services as necessary

notice how it goes. -> phase 4

if you can't quite make it work as advertised, do your best to set the volunteer right on their way. send them to someone who can do what was promised? do they need food, bathroom, phone charging, etc

take a snapshot and write a little blog post


phase 4: strategy // isn't this marketing?
-----------------------
(you know what the prototype does)

decision time.

is there something here that's worth trying in production? -> phase 5

do we want to try with different people? -> phase 3

do we want to try another prototype? -> phase 2

do we need more ideas? -> phase 0


phase 5: production
---------------------------
if you don't have a participator, find a customer who is having trouble

if you don't have a customer -> phase 8

if you need a worker, find one

offer the tool to them

notice how it goes.

did it go fine? -> phase 8

could it be better? -> phase 6

do you or they have questions about how the experience could be improved? -> phase 1

let the participants direct the design process

write a blog post with them

would the worker like more money? -> phase 8

is there anything else someone wants to sell? -> phase 5


phase 6: engineering
----------------------------
use automation to make the experience better for them

use automation to make it a better for you

did you make it substantially better? write a blog post about it

is this good enough to spend a few dollars on? -> phase 7


phase 7: release
----------------------
put up a let's get you paid wall somewhere.

set the price at what you think is a good price for the value as of now

all sales in the joint venture are split exactly according to hours worked by stakeholders

sales not what they need to be for stakeholders to feel compensated? -> phase 8

not too worried about money, but feel excited about making the product better? -> phase 6

want to grow your community while making the product better? -> phase 5


phase 8: marketing
--------------------------
is the service our homie is doing just not worth much to anyone? help them do more for more people, preferably people with money. these are our new values: this homie needs a customer -> phase 2

find someone who you think would enjoy the service for the price and offer it to them for as deep a discount as you can -> phase 5

if they don't want the service, ask there's something better that they do want, and offer to text them when it's ready. build a prototype to do that, and offer to them. if it sells better -> phase 5

do they want a job? -> go to phase 2 with "this other homie needs a job" as your core value
